### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 ### Hi, I'm [Johannes](https://github.com/JoHeinem), welcome to my page.
 
 ### About Me

There're few things more rewarding to me than to see how people accomplish their best and move mountains. I love helping engineers grow through coaching, mentorship, and leveraging them to excel at their work.

My approach is to really listen to people's needs and help them to develop in their careers. At the same time, I'm a very candid person, and everyone will know where they stand with me.

Identifying with the company I work for is crucial to me. I value transparency and a feedback culture as well as having an impact. That helps me to give everything I got to play a vital role in growing the company.

Personally, I love to pursue my curiosity and pick up new things. To give you one fact about me outside of work: I recently mastered the handstand - pretty cool, huh?
